MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.","04 24, 2013",A1LP4NB5X34HF8,A.Fenderson,"128 GB and 64 GB versions great, but can't confirm speed claims outside of the Class ratings",1366761600,sandisk,0.0005744970511910063,0.022712810699641282,0.013381801298275478,0.0005755414353303095,0.030333638280021443,0.0728172114500423,0.8596044997854981,04/24/2013

I later found out that since this card is formatted in ex-fat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms. Most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with ex-fat. So my only choice was to format the card to fat 32, which meant I couldn't put any files larger than 4gb on it. Besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of $50. If your some one who doesn't root their phone or put custom roms, nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you.

In May of 2013 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded.  Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone.  Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online).  One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine.  there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold.Original review:Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available.  No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space.  I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it.  Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)","09 5, 2012",A2Z4VVF1NTJWPB,A.

The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.

I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand.

It was not recognized, stopped, restarted, removed itself, reinstalled itself onto the phone - erratic behavior. Here is where I should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything I could before things hit the fan...unfortunately I waited too long and this morning, for no other reason than I turned my phone on, the card shows up as blank. Neither my Windows PC, nor my Mac, can even detect the card and yes, i tried two different adapters, and I tried the SanDisk recovery which ""found no recoverable files"" even though I checked all file type extensions.I've apparently lost all the pictures I had on there. To top it all off, my GF's cheap ""no name"" card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrily.Paying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months? No thanks. I'm going back to Lexar, which hasn't failed me yet. I'm also getting rid of all my SanDisk cards for my DSLR's, just in case.

They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

Add to it the reliable name of SanDisk and you are left with no doubts to buy this or not!!! Also its available at almost half the actual price with Amazon (I did check the price at local sellers and no one is selling it that cheaper).Comes with a decent writing speed (good for most shooting/recording devices) and has a very very long warranty (10 years !!!). The technology may take a leap before this one stops functioning on you.Want to use it as a SD card in your camera? No problem.

The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).  I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean?  It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.  However, if you think you need or might need a Micro SD down the road, this is a suitable solution.","11 26, 2013",A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7,A.

I've copied some WAV and MP3 files to this card from a fast PC (3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 7,200 RPM HDD, 64-bit Win 7, etc.) with a built-in card reader. The card reader maybe my bottleneck. Anyway, the observed average writing speed was around 9.5MB/s.Tried this card in Nokia 3555b. Logically this phone cannot read more than 8GB MicroSDHC cards, but it it. However, it saw the card as being only a 2GB card. Tried inMotorola Flipout Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Android Phone with Bluetooth, Camera, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. Played those WAV and MP3 files and it worked very well. Tried inMotorola MB520 Bravo Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3MP Camera, FM Radio and GPS - US Warranty - Blackwith the same files, and it worked well too. No hiccups. Then inserted (and left it in) inBLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black).

Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013.

SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn't open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don't fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there's a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren't the norm and it's easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996.

SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s.

I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were ""out of stock."" If they were out of stock, they sure got ""in stock"" in a big hurry.

It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one's going in the bin.","12 4, 2012",A24F83KRAZKWR5,Craig,"Cheap, fast SD card",1354579200,sandisk,0.18325483656417837,0.16755270582608295,0.010413610202145087,0.010554314805949918,0.05640904012294947,0.2838010012854181,0.2880144911932761,12/04/2012

I even got it wet (I mean soaked) and it is still working like a charm.I will definitely recommend this to anyone, and will be sticking with SanDisk for all my other devices.","03 9, 2013",A2QC7V9IXJC708,C.

They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux/unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the format.Having said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write fine on my computers.

For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated.","11 21, 2013",A154R0EH8V8J23,"Davey B.

I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers. Talk about instant gratification, we are aboutthere.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is a guide by the 'SD Association' with regard to Class ratings and video applications:> Class 2 for SD video recording> Class 4 and 6 for high-definition video (HD) to Full HD video recording,> Class 10 for Full HD video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills> UHS Speed Grade 1 for real-time broadcasts and large HD video files> UHS Speed Grade 3 for 4K video files-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USH-I overkill for a media player? Probably, but for the price it was a terrific deal to get a Class 10USH-1 enabled card and have the flexibility to use it in a variety of my electronic devices. Hmm. Onsecond thought I may just keep this card for the movie camera and get another ""slower"" one for mymedia player.As usual I have had no problems with this card. Works well, in or out of the adapter, and seems verytough in it's construction. 5 stars for this little power house of a micro card.","11 11, 2013",A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,"DMGenest | ""Genet""",High Speed Transfers:  Sandisk Ultra MicroSDHC Class 10 [UHS-I Enabled] Memory Card,1384128000,sandisk,0.15942013934017749,0.25488357856346894,0.043484053835014476,0.1117464169850238,0.0008224037571833149,0.15979046690967513,0.26985294060945697,11/11/2013

I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products.

I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card.

There was a small glitch where the Note asked to format the card after I removed it from the tablet and transferred about 25GB of data to the card (from my PC while it was in a card reader).

By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a no brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can find a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have...

I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC.

I had already copied all the music, pics and video off my older, slower and smaller card onto my computer so all I had to do was plug the phone into the computer, open the card and copy everything into it.  Everything went in with no problem.  I then unplugged it from the computer and tested my videos and music on the phone and everything worked like a charm.Bottom line, I did not have to format the card, I just plugged it into the phone, it was immediately recognized and worked like a charm.I would highly recommend this card based on the price and the product that you are receiving.","12 11, 2012",A36M8PAXD2T3SF,"Greg T ""Love Electronics""",No problems with my Galaxy S3,1355184000,sandisk,0.15772708705104602,0.023393196480257568,0.08044385199984219,0.029187296099715706,0.09219114204728326,0.04993366813017129,0.5671237581916841,12/11/2012

I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often).

2030,1338645,1338645,B007WTAJTO,"[1952, 2020]",5,"[[ UPDATE - 6/19/2014 ]]So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father's Day and I've been loving it ever since.  Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device.  Since it's been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new.  As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read/write data to the card.  Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10/UHS-I but that's just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices.  Since Amazon doesn't carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($34.27), Extreme ($57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4.  My question was, did I want to pay over $20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned?  Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone.  So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card.  I use my cell phone *more* than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it's good enough for my tablet.  I don't own a 4K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn't see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time.I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven't had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it.Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I've used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there's that confusion of what's the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for ""Secure Digital High Capacity"" and SDXC stands for ""Secure Digital eXtended Capacity"". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two ""highspeed"" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out.The remaining devices listed on Amazon's search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I'm not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn't sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven't run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the ""AFFP-A"" means ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging"". Other than that, these are exactly the same.  If you're wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.","05 1, 2013",A12B7ZMXFI6IXY,"Hyoun Kim ""Faluzure""",UPDATED - Great w/ Galaxy S4 & Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 - No Complaints Here!!!,1367366400,sandisk,0.21204789184736736,0.1721170449256658,0.0676348392107441,0.023702214009930164,0.04115069962389376,0.15841719848184316,0.32493011190055576,05/01/2013

The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for.SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to ""hard shutdowns"". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the 'Data Storage' menu on Android phones, there is an option to 'unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first ""Eject"" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for ""Safely Remov[ing] Hardware and Eject[ing] Media"". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android 'unmount' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.I cannot speak for how one would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you're using an Apple PC, you don't have an Android phone.","10 10, 2012",A2HYTUOURNH4AW,Jason J Chapman,Good flash card,1349827200,sandisk,0.12295831363588455,0.0010113736423043819,0.14110387171662828,0.027087103142315293,0.029067085325075424,0.23876928648831378,0.4400029660494783,10/10/2012

Well I can say that it does run hot.How hot you ask? I can feel it through the back cover of my Samsung Galaxy S3. Not plastic melting hot. But I know it is there.Is that an issue? Maybe? Maybe not! I have never really noticed any of my previous cards getting hot. Sure even some of my USB sticks run hot after a transfer.Is it cause for concern? I honestly don't know, yet.I will use it and see if heat causes any issues. If anyone has had the same problem feel free to comment and tell me what happened or if you contacted SanDisk.I am thinking about calling them and also Samsung to find out what max temperature range is acceptable. As I really don't want to ruin my bad-a$$ new phone.Otherwise this is a lot of space for cheap. Can't complain there. I gave it 5 stars for that reason alone.The heat issue is something else and I wont take a star off just because of that.But I will still be concerned until I have some answers.Thanks for reading.","01 2, 2013",AK2B87C1E0WD,"J.

The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME.","01 6, 2014",A1PSBR3JRZ9VO0,J.

They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash.

My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great.

I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an ""overall"" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a ""general"" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right.","10 20, 2012",A1AANYVDE04JF1,Lazer Fers,Good Card,1350691200,sandisk,0.03371383771277347,0.1759924894028797,0.014351015926687197,0.058309153865047654,0.06376859382388583,0.28980694649153793,0.3640579627771883,10/20/2012

It offered to format the card.I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card.  All went well.  Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64GB was available.  But, as it turned out, it was.While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter).  When that completed,I powered down the phone and put the new 64GB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter.It showed about 60GB (the usual for a 64GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from.  Take note: if you do *not* have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary.  If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above.  Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy.I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card.Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up.  It worked perfectly, right away.Root Explorer showed about 60GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me - I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card.  Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident.So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One!  What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.Caveat: Keep in mind that I just unwrapped this thing and have used it for all of two hours.","10 1, 2012",A3VSG5X7GPNNW6,Lou Thomas,Nexus One Loves This Card!,1349049600,sandisk,0.04890656540480485,0.028413789794849775,0.015039646400719116,0.0009061228148800576,0.0679271245668278,0.07755197686132607,0.7612547741565923,10/01/2012

I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate.","05 29, 2013",A12ESGQ81M70JX,mad G.I.,"After 6 months of using this card, nothing but errors.......expensive, junk.",1369785600,sandisk,0.10135830214871598,0.130152251357919,0.03122444495084673,0.04199602847645068,0.03688921269299441,0.18185594504497762,0.4765238153280956,05/29/2013

I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof.

Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it.  That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying ""digital copies"" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray.  You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into "".mp4"" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet.Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10GB per movie) ... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory.  That's where the tablet's microSD slot ... and this SanDisk flash memory ... comes in.  I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source.  Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play.  You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls.Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a memory card (rather than the tablet's internal memory) requires a memory card with very high ""read speed,"" and this SanDisk card's ""Class 10"" rating fills that bill.  That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer/read speeds.  The ""Class 10"" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10MB per second.  This SanDisk ""Ultra"" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device.""Frustration free packaging"" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener.  This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless.Finally, don't let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck.  While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any/all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk ""Ultra"" memory.  Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers ... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling/packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can.  I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay.  The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Tab 3 ... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3.  I may never have figured it out at all if I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" with which to compare the fakes.If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further ... this is it.","06 28, 2014",ADPDMLUDAMML0,Mark R.

After reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. Please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. I have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock Jelly Bean, 1 with Ice Cream Sandwich, and 1 with a Cyanogenmod custom firmware. All 3 devices have problems and say ""blank sd card"" or ""unsupported filesystem"". Even formatting the card in both Windows and using Android do not seem to fix the issue. I was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. It does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky.

As I write this review the card has been running in my Tab 3 and constantly used for over a week.Other reviews have dissected the specs of this card, so I'll share how I use it and why I prefer these over the 64GB cards (which I also own and use). The price point on these 32GB cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities. I use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop, so I always have a daily snapshot of my documents. For that purpose alone these cards are well worth it.For my tablet I have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards. A 32GB card will hold about 150 CDs, so the space savings along over the physical media is significant. In fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 CDs.These are also excellent for saving practice sessions that I sometimes record using my phone or tablet. I pop my primary SD card out of the device and swap one of these in to video record. Since this card will hold about six hours of video it's perfect for that use.Overall, these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of devices I own. I can assure anyone wanting to use them in a newer Samsung Note 2 or 3 phone or Tab 3 tablet that this card will work, and it is also excellent for HD video recording.

DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don't let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They're durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably.  Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price.","01 6, 2014",A36U8X10T0BFVJ,M.

If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn't be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn't fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it's first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.

Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp ""low rest"" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too.

3448,1340063,1340063,B007WTAJTO,"[1428, 1505]",5,"I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s in ""CrystalDiskMark"", 10.6MB/s in ""H2testw v1.4""). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using ""Flash Memory Toolkit"" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as ""2 to the power 30"", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32GB and 64GB cards on the same product page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with 'SDXC' in order to used the 64GB version. My original review refers to the 32GB 'SDHC' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select 'Retail Packaging', you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on 'Frustration Free Package', the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the card reader and USB 2.0 port used.

Here are the results from 'CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB/s (was 34.8MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB/s (was 12.6MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)","09 26, 2012",AOEAD7DPLZE53,NLee the Engineer,Top of the class among all (budget-priced) micro-SDHC cards I have tested / Works great in Galaxy S3,1348617600,sandisk,0.14828871780211433,0.2956701917617929,0.02497191048808763,0.07295803120234745,0.03366981883261066,0.12547092894325493,0.29897040096979216,09/26/2012

Finally, I had to put it in the adapter, and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that way.I think the issue was that using the USB 2.0 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop, transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card, the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful.

(Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!","06 5, 2013",A18HE80910BTZI,"rbhatta ""A Dinosaur you can trust!""",Works with GT-P5113 Samsung Tab 2!,1370390400,sandisk,0.15011085017537007,0.06833405946037352,0.013310207191538578,0.06383728499856207,0.08094364375817335,0.18432567157791738,0.439138282838065,06/05/2013

I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they'll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete.

Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one.

4211,1340826,1340826,B007WTAJTO,"[1568, 1694]",1,"NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless..

Sure, you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory, but they are quick to fix/replace it and that is what matters most.  Buying cheaper cards will land you with a read/write error when you can least afford it.  Don't be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card.I purchased this particular card for my Asus Transformer, as it fits nicely into the pad itself - and with the optional keyboard attachment (which is capable of holding standard SD cards) it fits there as well.  Making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors.

And although I haven't tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything else...So at first I thought maybe since it's only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn't be the case). Well after popping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I put it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it's all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that's really no big deal and totally worth it still.Bottom line, this SD plus the GoPro 3+ is the best camera combination for your money.P.S.

My single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter.  I use those!  Since I frequently switch cards between uses, and frequently have them in storage, those little boxes are very useful.

It's not quite up to what Sandisk achieves in full size UHS1 SD cards that can write over twice this speed, but those are electronically more complex cards. The Micro form factor likely doesn't permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards.  Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises.  (Note also that you will NOT achieve these speeds with a USB2 reader.  You will need either a USB3 or built-in PCIe reader to get accurate results.  So do not complain to me if you use a USB2 reader and don't achieve these speeds.)In any event, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything faster.My personal experience with Sandisk products is very good.

After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.","08 20, 2013",AWKYTPVNNZELL,"T.

But when formatted as exFAT, like is ideal for mobile devices, it would happen every time the phone was reset.  Take caution with these cards.

I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.

If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card.

Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- ""In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.This is the 3rd straight time that Amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating. This is not the Amazon shipping that I remember.","09 8, 2012",A21V240TAUTCTL,"Tommy ""Some Days You're The Dog ; Some Days Y...",Horrible Shipping,1347062400,sandisk,0.21721289746409353,0.12119350377892162,0.10660371125881798,0.04244550389876811,0.010013014106493691,0.05027358244995256,0.45225778704295244,09/08/2012

All of my work for the past decade fits into 32GBs. At $19, it costs less than any other class 10 card (in other words, it's the fastest at this price). It's plenty fast for me. But, as reviewer NLee points out, it is very easy to confuse this with much slower class 6 cards (so be careful as you compare). This card worked as soon as I plugged it in - with no problems. Highly recommended. Now, some test the Transend microSD as faster (see first commend for one URL), but performance is more likely limited by your reader. SanDisk is the most popular for good reasons (#1 selling microSDHC card at Amazon). Now, this also means it is the most popular to counterfeit (the likely source of most poor experiences - recent sources estimate that millions have been purchased just on eBay and others have confirmed getting fakes through Amazon vendors).

Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle/recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB/s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops/PCs support SD card.So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2!!! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read/write speed were not quite near 30MB/s, but it's still pretty good.My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level!!! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever.","03 7, 2014",A2DKQQIZ793AV5,Twister,Super high capacity!!!

They have crammed a TON of memory modules in that little bujgger, you know?

If you use a card reader built into a printer you will get slow speeds. If the card is close to full you will get slow speeds. If you have a cheap card reader IT might be the bottle neck.I recently purchased a USB 3 card reader, as my new motherboard has a couple of USB 3 ports. WRITE speeds for this card went through the roof. I downloaded a 4 gigabyte movie to the card, [keep in mind big files transfer faster] and it averaged 21 megabytes per second. That's twice the rated speed of the card. [Rating is based on minimum write speeds--Class 10 cards should give you no less the 10 MB/sec if there are no bottle necks.]The next movie I loaded was about the same size, but the card was nearly full and had had a lot of deletes, so the file was being scattered all over the card. Basically the equivalent of writing a lot of small files. The speed was about 11 MB/sec. This card provides great value.

Transcend 32GB SDHC Class 10 card is temperamental and unreliable. The older SANDisk and Wintec Class 10 cards, which I have put through their paces for a year by the time I received the Transcend, have never failed to display a file, nor thrown false 'format' error, nor forced a format to display the correct available space. Will never buy this brand again. Considering the hostile-to-customer all sales are final on storage media policy, this is not a bargain at any price. I include the original review after the initial use period just so you know that at first, the card does impress. But it has an abysmal life span.Orig. review:Jun13, apx 25USD, S&SbyAmaz;, 4 Stars Transcend SDHC Class 10 Works Great for Video. I use this in the Kodak Playsport Zx5 and it so far works as expected and records high quality video. Most SDHC cards of reputable make do so and are work horses as long as they're not handled carelessly. Fair price and does not pester me with bogus helper adware that just hogs storage space and gets in the way.","06 11, 2013",A3IGA0WPU0HRP2,"a.k.

I use them to hold pictures I have taken (several thousand a month).  I use them to transport data of all sorts.  I find them to work with all my devices.Now, for real-and-implied speed.  Unfortunately, each device, I have, treats each vendor's card, for some reason, differently.  I have found the same card works at top speed in one device; yet, in another device it is painfully slow.  Then -- ALSO -- slowness depends on my mood, attitude, and need in getting something done immediately and right now.  Perhaps, the card and what is being done is also a part of the slowness?On the other hand, there is no problem when what I am doing gets done very quickly regardless of which card I am using; AND, it may have been a card whose performance at another time was so slow; so painfully slow.  Which means benchmarks are wonderful and give a baseline though this baseline may be meaningless in actual operating conditions to include the type of information/data, stress and device and software and hardware and cables and etc. variances.Said another way, I have learned to buy the SDHC cards (CF and SDXC cards, too) based on my budget and previous experience.  This allows me to get cards that work in my devices.  I do not recall any of the hundred, or so, of these Transcend cards, that I have purchased at Amazon, ever going physically bad or becoming permanently unusable.I would say these cards are a good purchase for the price and my experience in using them.","11 14, 2013",AALR6CRH97JG1,"Amazon Customer ""NoClue-Really!""",I Flash with Transcend,1384387200,transcend,0.0847116557555063,0.21794742286631968,0.001417005671382717,0.07899582662218638,0.0014227518482527257,0.32167743231159945,0.2938279049247527,11/14/2013

This card will hold a lesser number of images than a 32GB or a 64GB card. But i prefer carrying around more number of cards with less capacity (8 or 16 GB) that the cards with large capacity.

As far as speed goes, I can't really say anything bad about this card as I don't know enough about its write speed. I can tell you that I recently bought aSanDisk Extreme 45MB/s 16GB SDHC Card (SDSDX-016G-AFFP)and that card does seem to write a bit faster. Also, with the SanDisk Extreme card, uploading images to my computer is quite a bit faster than this Transcend card. The difference is slight, but there is a difference. Don't know if that helps anyone. One thing I have learned with memory cards is that it's always good to have an extra one on hand when you're out and about shooting photos/video if that is what you're using the card for...because you never know when one card could get damaged or will fill up faster than you think it should.","06 2, 2012",A14MOU9MF0NNVB,"Angela ""Angel""",Great SD card for a great price!,1338595200,transcend,0.09174497262452573,0.3149825364709382,0.02081724443036689,0.16362596350745154,0.01474787599696238,0.11790304755156433,0.2761783594181908,06/02/2012

I usually get Sandisk products, and am especially fond of their CF cards. But when I got my Canon 60D and Canon PowerShot D20, I picked up a few of these smaller Transcend cards on sale. I'm also not a huge fan of larger cards for a variety of reasons, so keep handfuls of them around at about 16GB.Anyway, apparently when I was on vacation I popped one of these cards in one of the half dozen pockets of my cargo shorts when it was full-up, in it's little plastic case and promptly forgot about it. Since it's so small, it went unnoticed when doing a cursory pocket search before hitting the laundry. It got washed, dried and was in the process of being ironed when my wife noticed a bulge that wouldn't iron out. Yikes! Darned if all the photos weren't still accessible, and since then it's read and written just fine. I doubt that a CF card could have made the journey, but considering it got a soaking (even in the case) and a rather toasty drying, not too bad!Other than the washing, these cards have done their job and are fast - I have no problems going well above my rated burst speed and duration on a Canon 60D. I've shot well over 80 images (JPEG) without hitting the end of my buffer. Video has never been an issue. As far as I can tell, they easily match my Class 10 Sandisk Extreme cards (8 & 16GB). For doing what it's supposed to do, doing it well, and surviving above and beyond the call of duty I give it 5 stars.*** Update 11/26/12 ***The card is still chugging away.

However, for the price this is a very good value if you do not need the bleeding edge speed of other cards.  Most people do not need the highest speed cards as the hardware they are using them in is slower than this card.  The main exceptions to this are DSLR cameras and computers newer than ~2011.  Even in those devices the actual transfer speed increase with the faster cards is fairly minor and most people will never notice it.This is my fifth Transcend SD or micro SD card in the recent past.  All but one of them are still working with the oldest working one being a 128 MB ~8 years old card with very heavy daily use including being inserted and removed from card readers at least every few days.  the one that no longer works was a 64 MB micro SD card my wife got with her LG Musiq cell phone ~10 years ago.

Video however left me wanting more. Just seems slow to say class 10.With stills I shoot RAW. I went through up to 5 shots in continuous mode before having the camera slow and then up to 15 shots before it stopped to let the buffer empty. I was trying to shoot the hummingbirds around our house. As a result I lost a few good shots. The write speed was not all that good for action shooting. However, still shots were clear and perfect in single mode, and the card had no problem keeping up with write as long as the shutter released was pressed for each shot.With video, even thought it is a Class 10 card, I was having trouble with stuttering. I could not shoot more than 3 minutes at a time without running into pausing issues on the developed video, and eventually spent the money and bought a Sandisk Extreme card to replace it for video and action shots.I am happy with the card over all for my still work and portrait shots. I will order this one again to use for that purpose, but if you are looking to catch that perfect moment when you son kicks the wining goal, you don't want to slip on the shutter release, or have the buffer fill up on you.

According to the exFAT spec, exFAT should work with Vista as long as Service Pack 1 is installed. Neither of these cards did, however. Instead, there is a message stating the card must be formatted before it can be used. If I try to format it in Vista, NTFS, exFAT and FAT (not FAT32) are provided as options. It won't format the card using NTFS or exFAT and if you format it as FAT, the card only shows about 4 megabytes of memory rather than 64 GB.I rated this at 3 Stars since I don't have another Vista computer to experiment on. It could be something unique to the one Vista SP1 computer I did try. That computer has no problem reading other cards, though.

They said that is not an approved brand and I needed to get an approved brand and try it then call them back. I thought they were giving me the run around, wanting me to waste money on another memory card when this one has always worked fine for me. Well guess what? I bought a Sandisk Extreme card (one of Nikons recommended brands) and damned if that didn't fix my focusing issues. As soon as I find me a crow I'm gonna eat it because I was bad mouthing Nikon tech support until they proved that they were right.

It is everything I could hope for in this large SDHC Flash Memory Card.The Bad News!I installed the card and my camera tells me it can't write to it.  When I removed the memory card I noticed that the little yellow write protect switch in the side of the card was missing!  What?  How could it be missing and where is it!!  The card housing was never glued properly.  There were two small spots that were holding the housing halves together.  These came apart enough to allow the write protect switch to fall out, making the card unusable.  Panic set in worried about where the little yellow switch may have ended up.  Was it in my camera SD card slot or maybe in my laptop?  I had no idea.  Long story short, I found it on the floor.I thought about sending it in to Transcend for a replacement, but I didn't trust the replacement would be any better than this one.

It was while downloading pictures to my PC that the difference became very apparent. These are high end SD cards and their speed is remarkable to what you would find at Walmart and Radio Shack. It's worththe slight difference in price to get the faster SD cards and take and download pictures in less time. They hold more pictures than anyone could every possible fill in a days time, but it's insurance that you don't miss anything because of no capacity. I am truly amazed at how these media cards have progressed and I consider this card the best of the best. You never thinking about missing a shot because it would waste space.

Primarily that's because I don't format a card until the job is delivered.  (This serves as one of my four data backups.)  If I were shooting on cameras that only take a single memory card, I'd be inclined to spend the extra money on Lexar Pro or Sandisk Pro cards.  However, I use these cards in my Canon 5D mk III, which writes every shot to a CF card and an SD card for extra backup.When my 5D mk III was my primary body, I looked for the best performing Class 10 cards I could find.  (The 5d3 will happily use UHS-1 cards, but only at a Class 10 speed, so you're really only buying a card that will download to your computer faster over USB3.)  The 5d3's buffer only holds about 12 RAW files, and waiting for the camera to flush the data to the card is painfully slow.  (Not a problem if you ONLY shoot on the CF card, but again, backup is critical to me.)  Some class 10 cards can perform around 19MB/s write, but not these.  These meet only the minimum class 10 write spec of about 10MB/s.Now that the Canon 1DX is my primary body the slower performance is fine - when the 5d3 caps out, I just switch back to my 1DX while it flushes data.  If the 5d3 is your primary, and you get stuck waiting for the camera to flush after a burst, I'd recommend spending a little more so the camera can finish writing files faster.Here are the read/write scores of two identical 16GB SDHC Transcend cards:Card 1 Read: 21.36MB/sCard 1 Write: 10.66MB/sCard 2 Read: 21.82MB/sCard 2 Write: 10.45MB/sThese numbers are from a test that filled the entire card to capacity, then read that data back.  Not mind blowing, but I only use these smaller 16GB cards on short projects like engagement sessions, so they're fine for that purpose.","06 21, 2013",A1HLWWD2GTPB28,"Gavin Farrington ""Gavin Farrington, Photographer""",Good Value.

I previously purchased a Transcend 8GB Class 6 SDHC memory cardTranscend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card with USB Card Reader TS8GSDHC6-P2for another LCD digital picture frame but now since I had two frames, I now needed a 2nd SDHC card. For those not familiar with the brand, the market is dominated by the names of Sandisk and PNY and it can be quite confusing on which is a ""better"" product.First and foremost, if you don't have an SDHC card read on your PC or laptop, you need some kind of card reader.  Luckily my past purchase came with a USB adapter so this time around, all I had to do is just purchase the card itself.  Although I paid nearly the same price as my previous purchase, the reason for similarity in price is due to the fact that this card (being reviewed) is a Class 10 SDHC card. Class ratings have a specific purpose. The SD Association defines standard speed classes indicating minimum performance to record video. Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. These are defined in terms of suitability for different applications:Class 2 for SD video recordingClass 4 and 6 for HD ~ Full HD video recording,Class 10 for Full HD video recording and HD still consecutive recording.The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card:Class Minimum performanceClass 2 2 MB/secClass 4 4 MB/secClass 6 6 MB/secClass 10 10 MB/secSo you may be asking ""why did you buy a Class 10 card specifically for a digital picture frame, which wouldn't dare need to meet those speed performances""?  While your question may be valid, remember I'm using these for pictures... hundreds if not thousands of pictures... that need to be transferred from my PC to the card itself.  The class speed specification also applies to files being copied to/from the card itself. So with that said, I got a class 10 because the price is fairly cheap (cheaper than when I looked in 2011) plus I'm ""future proofing"" myself in the event that I want to use this card for another purpose (perhaps a future digital SLR camera).Doing simple transfer tests, I did achieve slightly over a 10 MB/sec transfer rate while copying pictures to this card. While others may boast that the Sandisk high speed cards are able to transfer faster, they also cost an arm and a leg. Transcend is the only card that has decent performance at a very affordable price. I know I only own two of them, but because of the value I can easily see myself looking to buy more of them in the future.Recommended.","12 4, 2012",A12B7ZMXFI6IXY,"Hyoun Kim ""Faluzure""",Repeat Buyer of Transcend Memory Cards - Works Great,1354579200,transcend,0.12058501036180636,0.39114398650859716,0.0007077097627396685,0.09003685295789379,0.09865146943398177,0.16618104862513822,0.13269392234984298,12/04/2012

My computer recognized the card, and the camcorder recognized the card was present, but said that recording to it was not possible.I have a Kingston 32GB SDHC card that I use for my camcorder and it works just fine (and it's only a Class 4) so it must just be some sort of inexplicable incompatibility between this card and my camcorder.I returned the card for a refund, which was free, easy, and simple with Amazon's return procedure.","12 5, 2011",A23A0SXUF6KKF3,Jammer,Did not work with Canon Vixia HF200 camcorder,1323043200,transcend,0.0863077501555646,0.06482020837968153,0.0024664456642437232,0.13415308901696574,0.0024668355089624517,0.09335953490161253,0.6164261363729694,12/05/2011

I'm very impressed then that these cards are extremely reliable and tough. I can't imagine why people would spend two or three times as much on a card. Also, even though I write photo books for a living including [[...]], I have to say that the whole card-speed issue is a mystery wrapped in a riddle. Manufacturers have not made any effort to establish a consistent and reliable method for comparing the read/write speed of various cards. The speed rating system is confusing, at best. With almost all (not all) cameras, these cards will perform more quickly than your camera's buffer can keep up with. It's the camera that is usually the slow link. Also, many cameras don't have the capability to take advantage of very fast cards, so be sure to read your camera's manual before you spend a boatload of money on super-fast cards.Overall I think these Transcend cards are a great bargain and I use them daily and have for years. Don't get snowed by advertising claims from the biggies--for the most part they're blowing smoke. One thing though, unless you are using these cards for shooting video when you might need huge storage, I'd stick to a max of 16 or even 8 gigs. If you take a 32 gig card on vacation and lose it, yikes, you've lost a whole trip. When I'm on a travel assignment, I shoot 8 gig cards and download them (and burn them to dvd) at the end of the day--and then a few times a week I overnight the actual cards home.","12 18, 2012",A1O97WKID9L3IA,"Jeff Wignall ""Photographer, Author and Radio ...","These cards are great: fast, reliable and a bargain",1355788800,transcend,0.13708638427550254,0.39839932810082745,0.03500481482788055,0.05364310961690535,0.07460365705101545,0.2127091108255939,0.08855359530227468,12/18/2012

That may seem like a fairly long time, but compared to just about any other transfer of 10GB, this is blazing fast. The only faster data transfer I can think of is USB3.0, but nobody uses that anyway hahaWrite - I can fill my camera's buffer if I do a lot of bursting in RAW+JPEG, but that's only if I shoot 20+ images at 16MP, and do it about as fast as my camera shoots.  If HD video is your thing, even 100Mb/s bitrates move onto the card smoothly, no lag etc.Capacity - I have a hard time filling this one up - I usually shoot my battery dry before my SD card.  Once formatted, the usable space is 15.00GB.Shipping - It shipped quickly and I got it on the first day in the window (3 days after shipping)Overall a product meeting expectations, a great deal as well.

From a brief survey of review sites, I get the impression that Transcend represents a lower-priced but still &#34;legitimate&#34; brand.There are faster/&#34;better&#34; cards out there, but if you want &#34;good enough for lowest cost&#34; with a reasonable expectation that it will continue to work, this is the best I could find.","03 23, 2013",A1C9B8JDY0HT19,Jin Choi,Good value for a name brand,1363996800,transcend,0.08295894859077953,0.30947757714045737,0.06380843303437761,0.2016566220428399,0.1864703769536125,0.00350620468675519,0.15212183755117792,03/23/2013

I saw the prices on SD cards were kind of low, so I went for the 16GB class 10 card by Transcend (TS16GSDHC10E), and I am glad I did.  The card gets me about 15-20 mbps write speed (35mbps read speed) according to Win8, and it worked almost out-of-box with the 3DS.  I say 'almost' because I had to use the SDHC format tool before the 3DS would understand the card was there.Anyway, this is a great card for Nintendo 3DS.  I highly recommend it.  It makes the space a lot higher (14.7 gigs after format), and it makes booting the 3DS menu a lot quicker because of the larger space allowance and the higher read/write speeds.  Be warned, though, that transferring 3DS files to a new card can be risky.  Save a backup of your data in a folder on your computer for safe keeping.The card also seems to work well in both of my digital cameras, but I hardly ever use my cameras, so I cannot give a worthy opinion about long term camera use.  It should work fairly well, though, and the price is very nice.  It's worth a shot at only $12.72!  Plus, Transcend is a good brand in my opinion.  I have yet to get a product by them that was below standards.  This card met all my expectations and even surprised me a little at such a low price.

Recently she had to send the camera to Nikon to have the socket that the CF card plugs into replaced, a pretty expensive repair.  Those little fingers that the CF card seats on are fragile while the contacts used by an SD card are not so fragile.  SD cards are also less expensive than CF cards having the same capacity.I love the quality I get and the lens choices I have with the D200 but I find I use my Nikon V1 more than the D200 and part of that reason is the SD cards it uses rather than the CF card.

Set on RAW only, I had no issues with writing speed when shooting 8fps for short bursts (roughly 2 second bursts), so JPEG will be a no brainer.  However I have not shot bursts while recording in both RAW and JPEG, so I can't comment on that.What I can say is that I initially thought I may need to step up to an Extreme series SD card for writing speed, but as it stands now I think I'll be happy with these (I'm buying more) cards.","06 18, 2011",AGCZ7KS4UUWHB,J.

I owned a Class 6 Transcend 8GB card for a long time and it was fast and never had any problems, so I figured I should get two of these class 10 cards as backup as i wasn't going to be bringing my laptop with me.Despite these being class 10 and therefore supposed to be faster, the ones i received are SLOWER than my class 6.  I tested both cards and took various photos around the house and noticed there's a distinct 2 second or so lag after i take a photo.  With my class 6 card, I can take a photo and immediately change to view mode to look at what i just took a pic of.  With the class 10 card when I do this, I get a message saying something like ""recording, please wait"" for around 2 seconds before my photo appears.  When taking photos too, with the class 10 there's a very obvious 2 second lag after each photo.I kept both cards because I was paranoid i'd run out of space on my class 6 card and i already tossed the packaging (returns seems to require original intact packaging?  how does that work if i obviously have to open it to test the card? O__o ).  Ultimately my single class 6 8gb card from years ago was plenty for my trip so these two cards were a waste purchase...probably giving one to mom when i buy her a new camera later.in any case, these cards are oddly far slower than my class 6 transcend 8gb cards.

I'm a 60D owner and this card does not shoot videos. Well, let me be more specific... It does not shoot videos consistently. I have to keep pushing record again and again and again, and once in awhile, it will record without stopping. Anyway, I've put in an order for a 32gb Amazon Basics and a Sony brand as well. Lets see if I have any luck with those. The ""MOST HELPFUL CRITICAL REVIEW"" also has issues with the Canon 60D, so I guess I'm not alone.

If you are taking bursts of a longer duration, you may want to get a faster card. Otherwise, imho this card is plenty capable of handling most people's burst needs.Slightly off topic, but as a sub-rating, I gave this card three stars for ""storage capacity"" because it has a truly ""average"" amount of capacity...as compared to other 32 GB cards. What a silly thing to rate -- two years ago, this capacity would have been thought gigantic, and two years from now, it will be small. There is a separate rating for ""value for money,"" which takes into account the capacity vs. price. So I'm not sure why Amazon is asking reviewers to rate ""storage capacity"" as an attribute.

I have other Transcend SD cards in smaller sizes and those work great too. The price on this card is definitely better than I could find for other brands of the same size, as well.Update (07/13/12):I found a problem with this card if you're using it in a DSLR for video. I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself. I also don't know if this only happens with certain cameras.This is the only problem I've had with this memory card and for everything else, it works great.","02 6, 2012",A2JMSGKG0J5E38,Lisa,Works great with lots of room,1328486400,transcend,0.0009300760107812297,0.13267877644056716,0.061514945015963864,0.19516538112812726,0.18456010118446678,0.22435624299321244,0.20079447722688126,02/06/2012

For the average snapshooter, that's no big deal. Class 4 will do nicely. But if you plan to shoot video, you need at least a class 6 card. And the faster a card can accept data, the more expensive it generally is.This 16 GB card is a class 10. In other words, HD video should be no problem. And at 16 GB, it'll hold a lot of data.

I've been using 1 in a Nikon D5100 and discovered that there was a huge delay in being able to shoot the next shot. This appears to be due to a very slow write speed for the card. I've tried 2 different cards and same thing. To compare, I used a Samsung SDHC 64GB PRO UHS-1 and there is hands down no comparison - the Samsung blows the Transcend card away. There is hardly any delay between shots, which is essential for doing bursts.I also have used the Trascend cards in my Canon HR20 HD camcorder. There is occasional jitter/frame loss in complex scenes when I use this card. I suspect this is also due to the slow write speed of the card. In comparison, if I use the Samsung card in the HR20, there is no such jitter/frame loss.Finally, I've used the transcend in a simple Sony Cybershot point and shoot camera. Again, there is noticeable delay between shots. Again, I suspect due to slow write speed. The Samsung also improved reducing the delay, but not fully. So, I can't discount the possibility that that Sony camera is simply poor at being able to do multiple shots quickly.I learned the hard way that Class 10 cards are not made equal.  What irked me the most was the card that failed. I had used it in a Zoom H4N digital audio recorder which I was planning to use in a video interview. Turned out when I went to try to play the audio, the Zoom kept having issues finding the files. I put the card in the PC to see if it would have better luck. While Windows could &#34;see&#34; the files, it also could not open them. Eventually, Windows reported a drive issue with the card. I tried running analysis software on the card and it detected numerous errors. Piece of junk. Fortunately, I had the audio that was taken with the camcorder itself, which fortunately, had decent fidelity I could use. I am so glad I did not rely on this card for anything as the sole source. This experience alone has soured by opinion of Transcend and will probably never trust it again. Cards like the Samsung may be more expensive, but may be there's a reason these Trascend card are so cheap.","05 18, 2013",A1FEI4HDXTA454,"Michael ""Tell us about yourself!""",Dissapointing - slow and 1 failed,1368835200,transcend,0.05380118928043989,0.3369338942251332,0.04811065534918045,0.0478594709253354,0.04092806111034633,0.14327828244705168,0.329088446662513,05/18/2013

I cant say that I noticed a difference in quality versus the class 6 but I do notice for photography I can get more shots holding the shutter on the class 10 versus the class 6. With that said I maybe not be getting my moneys worth for video mode as you could probably just stick with a class 6 32gb if they sell one, but for me its not a big deal seeing as though the card only cost me 40 bucks which is a decent price for 32gbs!! I used to think 8 gbs was alot for photos but 32gb well serve me even better. I might purchase another one along the way. Ive researched sandisk cards and the extreme they sell that supports 30mb/s is no longer available, and there are now companies on amazon scamming people into thinking the card supports this bitrate which is sad. So I Just stick with transcend because I have bought from them in the past and they are of good quality.

I bought this SD instead after reading that it was great for the Canon T2i. Sure enough, it's true! It handles what I need it to do (I shoot 1080 25p video and take the occasional photo).Update 1: Lately I've been getting sporadic flickers in my video when I use this card. Re-formatted and still doesn't solve the flickers. Even when I remove Magic Lantern and turn off all auto adjustments and custom funtions (auto focus, auto white balance, auto exposure, highlight tone priority, etc), I still get them. It's very annoying.I've tested the card with CDM3's software and found out the read speed is a bit over 19Mb/s and the write speed is a bit over 16Mb/s. I think the flicker is due to the card's slow write speed. I'm going to buy a Sandisk Extreme and see if it gets rid of my problem.

If you've been doing system updates as they come out you'll be fine (we have version 4.3 right now) but if your Wii isn't connected to the Internet you'll have to update your system manually; see Nintendo's site for instructions.As an aside, Amazon's frustration-free packaging is great.

However to me this was pretty much a non issue when deciding to by another 64 GB for my Panasonic HMC40P entry level Pro video camera.The first version of this particular cam could only take up to 32GB cards - but you can now bump it up to as high as 128 GB. When the card arrived it took multiple efforts to format - as I dug deeper into the reviews albeit most are positive the complaints were pretty much all the same:* Trouble formatting* Cameras not turning off* Distortion and surprisingly slow rendering time for a class 10My first inclination was that the problem was within the cameras card reader so I placed a call to Panasonic Pro cam support. The feedback I received was in a nut shell to stick with Sandisc as they've had numerous calls regarding problems with the Transcend cards.Bottom line - these cards may be less expensive but cheaper of course never means better. I think for certain applications Transcend is still a find choice for low to mid level cameras and camcorders.

6998,678467,678467,B002WE6D44,"[0, 0]",5,"Why I Bought This Particular Card-1) I have had good luck with this brand on cross-platform uses (Mac & PC) The one time I needed tech support, I was on hold for about one minute & actually received an answer from someone I could understand.2) I wanted a faster card for data transfer between computers.3) My existing (non Transcend) camera card is getting pretty wonky & unreliable.4) This card kind of covered all the above bases at a reasonable price.What I Found Out While Testing (And goofing around):In The MacBook Pro Running OS X 10.6.8- Card Formatted To FAT 32Reliability: This card works fine for moving large files between computers. I've had no files corrupted nor lost.Speed: Scary Fast. Remember, the speed will be limited by the card  reader & the bus speed of the machine.Initialization: Instant recognition by the Mac. Available immediately. OS X is so cool about fast access.In The MacBook Pro Card Formatted For Mac Only (OS X Extended Journaled)- Same results as FAT 32 (But, of course, no Windows transfers)In The Virtual PC Running XP Pro via Virtual Box-No Problems. Same as the Mac, but slower initialization. All devices are recognized faster on Unix based machines than Windows.In The VIrtual PC Running Windows 98SE-Windows 98SE got kind of crabby about this card. To be fair, it complains about everything USB.It kinda-Sorta works, but does not set any speed records. It is recognized as 512mb, but I put 4 gb of data on it without problems.In Windows 98SE on a physical machine- This card was not recognized. But... I did not attempt to find a solution. No Comment.In The Canon A590is Camera-Reliability: I have not lost any photos. But, regardless of which card I use, I would never trust valuable photos to just onecard. Ideally, split them up. Share the risk.Initialization: This card is slower to be available than my class 4 cards.I would imagine, quite simply, because it is a bigger storage device for the camera to 'study'.On the class 4 256mb card, with no data- It takes less than one second for the camera to recognize the card & let it be accessed.On this class 10 8mb card, with no data- The camera takes about 5 seconds to allow the card to be used. Big deal, huh?Recording Photos: I set the camera to its largest file format of 3264x2448 least compression (3.436mb)I was able to take more than one photo per second. It went too fast for me to time.The speed stayed consistant from empty card to full card. (Which was a ton of photos.)On-Camera playback was equally as fast.For Reference- With the MMC card that came with the camera- I can shoot one photo on this resolution every 3-4 seconds.Recording Video: The card worked fine. I filled it up & played back a captivating movie about my workshop. Ooh! Ahh!The card performed very well. There was no jumping & no fluttering on the video.In The Printer-  Brother MFC- J6710DWDirectly In The Printer's Card Slot- Recognized & available immediately. Scrolling was the same speed as my other cards.I suppose the scrolling speed is the limitation of the printer. (For the record- Less about one second between photos)In The Printer's USB Slot Via A Card Reader- Noticeably slower. This must be the reader or the printer's bus.Would I Buy Another-Yes- Without Hesitation","10 28, 2012",A2P0J63XX5P4S6,"PJB ""P""","Works Fine In Mac, Windows XP Pro and In Canon A590is Camera",1351382400,transcend,0.12768988198108475,0.17097604395449945,0.0306209226200281,0.0641225336548342,0.06241099227045098,0.20405447613171743,0.3401251493873851,10/28/2012

Both cards worked fine out of the box. Their performance exceeds the demands of this camera and there are no delays attributable to the card. I've tested HD Video, Super Slow Motion at 120fps and 240fps, 2.3 fps continuous full-resolution shooting, fast single-shot pictures, and Hi-Speed Burst HQ mode. In burst mode, the camera takes 8 full resolution pictures in under 1 second, then the activity light blinks for just over 3 seconds as the pictures are processed and stored. I've tested the burst with simple scenes (1 MB per photo) and detailed scenes (4.5 MB per photo) and there is no performance difference, so the SDHC card is not the bottleneck.I'm perfectly happy with these cards. I've used various Transcend SDHC and CF cards for compacts and DSLRs for 50,000+ photos and never had a problem with them, so I trust the brand and find the price/performance to be a perfect fit for high-end consumer cameras.","11 10, 2011",A2CSVHAAUB97DN,PJ,"Good price/performance, works perfectly with Canon S100",1320883200,transcend,0.052747634794947304,0.34485915963346897,0.0015909855762869518,0.0233729754869232,0.16096279030673116,0.2778764552184514,0.1385899989831909,11/10/2011

It didn't start right away.  I took about 70 pictures and 2 videos before things started to slowly crumble.  On a couple of photos, the camera could not view them and called them &#34;unidentified images&#34;.  When uploaded to a computer, those photos did transfer, but strangely only 1/2 the picture showed up.  Then the total breakdown occurred when the camera simply told me &#34;memory card error&#34;.  I couldn't view any images, nor upload any that hadn't been.  I originally put the blame on the camera, which was clearly wrong.  Camera's fine.  Couldn't be better actually, now that that card is out.I contacted Transcend and they directed me to their website where they have a lost data recovery program for download called &#34;RecoveRx&#34;.  I downloaded it and gave it a try and it did recover most of my photos.  It took the program about 9 hours of running time to do this btw.  Unfortunately, not all pics were recovered and definitely not the videos (which were the most important things on the card!).  I sent the card in to Transcend and they are in the process of sending me a new card...which will work this time...right?  The only way one can professionally have their memory card resurrected would be to send it overseas to the tune of 3 months processing time plus who knows how much $.  I weighed the cost and time to the need to get those videos back and it just didn't add up.  So I cut my losses and am getting a new card.  I am certainly gun shy at this point though in shooting photos.  I'm sure things will turn out fine in the end, but I'm longing for the days when the only way you could lose your photos was to open the back of your camera by accident!Best of luck to other Transcend card users out there, of which there must be quite a few.","04 7, 2013",A2L9KQ6RT13GLY,"Ron C.

I'm also receiving a camera error when using this specific card in which I cannot shoot any video at all sometimes.  Despite formatting the card a few times, the problem persists.  This does not happen with the other cards I have from other manufacturers.  I can't say I know exactly what the problem is but I don't really care about that.  What matters is that it only happens with this card in the camera.  I bought this card so I could shoot more video with the greater storage capacity.

With fine JPEG only, I got 10 or so shots in a 1-second burst, then about 2 per second thereafter. Standard JPEG is only marginally better.The good news is that I never shoot burst/continuous, so this isn't an issue for me. These cards are so inexpensive you could just file them away when you fill them and leave it to future generations to sort out your images.The other good news is that I can shoot HD video (60p) on these cards with the Nex 5n or on my Canon Vixia HF M40 camcorder.
